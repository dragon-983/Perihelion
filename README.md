## Overview

Perihelion lets a user declare a simple **intent** — _"I want X amount of asset Y
on Stellar"_ — and a decentralized network of **solvers** competes to fulfill it,
atomically and at the best available rate. No manual bridging steps, no token
wrapping, no fragile multi-transaction dance.

It is built natively on [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org), Stellar's smart
contract platform, and is designed for the way Stellar actually works: fast
finality, low fees, and a growing ecosystem of real-world assets that need
seamless liquidity connections to the rest of the blockchain world.

The model is proven on Ethereum — it is the same architecture behind
[UniswapX](https://uniswap.org) and [CoW Protocol](https://cow.fi) — but it has
been largely absent from Stellar. Perihelion brings it to Soroban and uses it to
solve Stellar's single most important growth bottleneck: **inbound liquidity.**

## Why Perihelion

### The problem

Stellar has become critical financial infrastructure — over **\$2B in tokenized
real-world assets**, institutional-grade stablecoins (USDC, EURC, YLDS, MGUSD),
and payment rails used by MoneyGram, Franklin Templeton, and PayPal.

But moving assets _onto_ Stellar from Ethereum, Base, or any other major chain
still requires one of:

- **Centralized exchanges** — custodial, KYC-gated, slow withdrawals.
- **Manual DEX hops** — multiple transactions, MEV exposure, poor rates.
- **Lock-and-mint bridges** — custodial wrapper assets and a long history of
  catastrophic exploits.

Capital that should be flowing into Stellar's DeFi, lending markets, and RWA
platforms sits on other chains because the on-ramp is too hard.

### The solution

Perihelion replaces all of that with a single signed message. The user never
touches a wrapper asset, never executes a multi-step bridge, and never takes
custodial risk. Either they receive at least the amount they asked for on
Stellar, or they are refunded in full on the source chain. There is no state in
which a user loses funds mid-bridge.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intent-based UX** — users sign _what they want_, not _how to get it_.
- ⚡ **Atomic settlement** — fill both legs or refund; no partial states.
- 🤝 **Solver competition** — an open network races to give users the best rate,
  instead of a single privileged operator.
- 🔓 **Permissionless** — anyone can run a solver, a relayer, or a keeper. No
  allowlist gates liveness, and the refund path needs no privileged actor.
- 🛰️ **LayerZero-secured messaging** — verified cross-chain delivery with a
  multi-DVN trust model, plus a roadmap to ZK state proofs (Protocol 24).
- 🪙 **Canonical assets** — users receive real Stellar assets sourced from solver
  liquidity, never a synthetic wrapper.
- 🧱 **Built for contributors** — a clean monorepo with scoped, skill-tagged
  issues for [Drips Wave](https://communityfund.stellar.org) sprint cycles.

## How It Works

Perihelion uses an **intent + solver** architecture:

1. **The user declares an intent.** They sign a structured message off-chain
   specifying the asset and amount to receive on Stellar, the asset and chain to
   spend from, a deadline, and a slippage floor. No transaction, no gas yet.
2. **Solvers compete to fill it.** A decentralized network of solvers monitors
   the intent mempool and races to fill profitable orders. The winner earns the
   spread between what the user offered and what the solver sourced.
3. **Atomic settlement.** The user's funds are locked in the source-chain escrow
   against a cryptographic commitment; the solver fronts liquidity on Stellar;
   the escrow releases the locked funds to the solver once settlement is verified
   over LayerZero. If the deadline passes without a fill, the user is refunded.
4. **Trust-minimized messaging.** Cross-chain messages are carried by
   [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network) with an independent multi-DVN verifier
   set, and — on the roadmap — Stellar's native ZK proof support (Protocol 24)
   for the most sensitive path.

## Architecture

### Settlement flow

```

### The intent hash

A single value — the EIP-712 `intent_hash` — ties every leg together. It is:

- the commitment the EVM escrow locks the user's funds against,
- the identifier carried in every LayerZero message,
- and the key the Soroban settlement contract uses for replay protection.

The hash is computed identically by the SDK (`hashIntent`) and the EVM escrow
(`hashIntent`), so every component keys off one stable identifier. The full
design — storage layout, state machine, message formats, threat model, and
phased rollout — is in the
**[Technical Architecture Specification](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Repository Layout

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1** | Guarded mainnet-beta: one corridor, allowlisted solvers, value caps | DVN set + team multisig (timelocked)     |
| **Phase 2** | Multi-route, permissionless solvers & relayers               | DVN set only (no per-operator trust)     |
| **Phase 3** | ZK state-proof verification (BN254 / Protocol 24), on-chain governance | Proof-system soundness                   |

Each phase has measurable acceptance criteria and an external **audit gate**
before the next begins. See the
[phased rollout](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#8-phased-rollout) for details.

## Project Status

Perihelion is in **active early development**. Current focus: the Soroban
settlement contract and the intent specification.

> ⚠️ **The interfaces and on-chain formats described here are not yet stable, are
> unaudited, and may change before the first audited release. Do not use in
> production.**

We build in public and welcome contributors at every stage — from architecture
discussions to the first lines of contract code.

## Implementation Status

Status of each component as of `HEAD`. Rows are written against the code, not
against the roadmap: read a row as a claim about what the code does today. CI
fails if a row here links to a closed issue (`scripts/check-status-links.mjs`).

| Component | Status | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LayerZero Endpoint (Soroban)** | Interface + Mock | `contracts/soroban/settlement/src/endpoint.rs` defines the `LzEndpoint` trait as a minimal, swappable abstraction. During this phase, a mock contract implements this surface; the real endpoint (or a thin adapter) will implement the same signature once the Soroban LayerZero stack is GA. The Soroban side does not yet communicate with a live LayerZero endpoint. |
| **Inbound FillInstruction Codec** | Decoder implemented and reachable | `messages.rs` decodes `FillInstruction` and `CancelIntent` from LayerZero bytes, and `Perihelion::lz_receive_bytes` (`lib.rs`) is a raw-`Bytes` entrypoint that decodes and dispatches them: the call is authenticated against the endpoint and the registered peer, then decoded by the same `decode_message` the differential-fuzz harness fuzzes, then routed through the same pause gate, nonce guard and handlers as the typed `lz_receive`. The decoders are `pub` and compiled into the release `cdylib`. The LayerZero adapter that will deliver the bytes is still a mock (`endpoint.rs`), so nothing on the live network calls `lz_receive_bytes` yet, and the differential-fuzz harness verifies codec parity against the specification rather than against a live endpoint. |
| **Relayer EVM Watcher** | Implemented | `relayer/src/evm-watcher.ts` polls source-chain logs through viem with bounded block ranges and concurrent transaction fetches. |
| **Relayer Soroban Delivery** | Implemented, archived-entry restore incomplete | `relayer/src/soroban-delivery.ts` builds, simulates, and submits `lz_receive` calls against the settlement contract. Archived ledger entries are detected but the `RestoreFootprint` operation is not yet constructed from the simulation footprint, so delivery to an archived contract still fails. Tracked by the `TODO(#303)` in that file; [#303](https://github.com/Perihelion-Protocol/Perihelion/issues/303) is closed, no successor filed yet. |
| **Solver Executor** | Implemented | `solver/src/executor.ts` implements all three settlement legs: `lockOnEvm` calls `PerihelionEscrow.lock` via viem (quotes the LayerZero fee, submits the tx, waits for receipt); `fillOnSoroban` builds, simulates, signs, and submits a `fill_intent` call against the Soroban settlement contract, polling until confirmation; `isSettled` simulates a `status` view call and checks for the `Settled` variant. `loadExecutorConfig` validates all required env vars at startup and throws a consolidated error before the solver loop begins, so misconfiguration fails loudly rather than per intent. |
| **Value Caps / Circuit Breaker** | Implemented (rolling window only) | Rolling-window value caps and a latching breaker exist on both chains: `PerihelionEscrow.sol` (`rollingWindowCap`, `rollingWindowTriggered`, `resetRollingWindow`) and `lib.rs` (`set_rolling_window_cap`, `reset_rolling_window_cap`). Once tripped, the breaker stays tripped until an admin resets it. Known issues: the breaker sets `rollingWindowTriggered` then reverts, discarding it ([#696](https://github.com/Perihelion-Protocol/Perihelion/issues/696)); `resetRollingWindow` does not clear accumulated bucket ([#697](https://github.com/Perihelion-Protocol/Perihelion/issues/697)). There is still **no per-intent maximum lock**: a single intent of any size passes as long as the window cap is not exceeded. |
| **Asset Allowlist** | Implemented | `PerihelionEscrow.sol` enforces an asset allowlist via `setAssetAllowed` (owner-only, timelocked). Every `lock` call checks `assetAllowed[token]` and reverts with `AssetNotAllowed` if false. A freshly deployed escrow accepts no assets until the owner populates the allowlist. This provides defense-in-depth against malicious or buggy tokens, but adds operational overhead (every new asset requires a timelock operation). |
| **Dispatch Confirmation (split-fill path)** | Implemented, keeper incentive added | `dispatch_confirmation` (`lib.rs`) dispatches the FillConfirmed cross-chain message independently of the asset delivery step (`deliver_intent`), making the messaging leg retriable (Issue #12). The entrypoint is permissionless and bypass-pause-safe (Issue #288), so any party can push a stalled confirmation through. A configurable `DispatchKeeperReward` (set via `set_dispatch_keeper_reward`) compensates third-party keepers for the LayerZero fee, making the retry path economically self-sustaining. `list_undispatched_intents` provides a batch monitoring view for intents that are `Filled` (delivered) but not yet `ConfirmationSent`. See the [Solver Runbook](./docs/running-a-solver.md#filled-but-undispatched-the-split-entrypoint-stall) for the risk description and operator checklist. |
| **SDK Deployment Addresses** | Placeholder | `sdk/src/deployments.ts` ships placeholder addresses. The SDK cannot target a live deployment until they are filled in. |

This section is maintained as features land, and a PR that changes a component's
status is expected to update the affected row. For an exhaustive implementation
roadmap, see the [phased rollout](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#8-phased-rollout)
section of the Technical Architecture.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome at every level. The project is structured around
clearly scoped, skill-tagged issues designed for
[Drips Wave](https://communityfund.stellar.org) sprint cycles, across four
tracks: **Rust/Soroban**, **Solidity**, **TypeScript**, and **Documentation**.

1. Read the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
   [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
2. Browse the [issue taxonomy](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#9-contribution-guide-for-drips-wave)
   to find work matched to your skills and a Wave cycle.
3. Open or claim an issue, branch, implement with tests, and open a PR.

All PRs run through CI (`npm test`, `cargo test`, `forge test`) and are reviewed
against the protocol's [design invariants](./docs/TECHNICAL-ARCHITECTURE.md#0-design-invariants-read-first).

## Trust Assumptions

The claims above ("no custodial risk," "never lose funds mid-bridge") describe
the **normal intent flow**: while a lock is in transit, the protocol's
invariants (I1–I5, see [Architecture](#architecture)) guarantee a user is
either settled or refunded. They do not describe the **governance layer**.
Scoped honestly, per role:

| Role | Can do | Cannot do | Bounding mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Solver / Relayer / Keeper** | Delay or decline to act | Steal funds, forge a fill, censor permanently (anyone can take over) | Permissionless; wire-format and signature checks |
| **LayerZero DVN set** | — | — | Root of message authenticity; a colluding DVN set can forge a fill (see [T16](./docs/threat-model.md#t16--layerzero-endpoint-compromise--malicious-origin-spoofing)) |
| **Guardian (EVM)** | Pause new locks, for up to 72h per 144h cycle | Move funds, change config, unpause, block local refunds | Auto-expiry + cooldown ([T11](./docs/threat-model.md#t11--guardian-key-dos-via-repeated-instant-pause)) |
| **EVM timelock owner set** | Rotate the peer, guardian, or grace period; withdraw genuine surplus token balance via `skim`; manage asset allowlist via `setAssetAllowed` | Withdraw locked user deposits; bypass the timelock delay for peer/grace/guardian changes | M-of-N confirmation + public delay for config changes; `skim` is bounded on-chain by `totalLocked[token]` accounting (`balanceOf(this) - totalLocked[token]`) ([T17](./docs/threat-model.md#t17--governance-extractable-escrow-balance)); asset allowlist is enforced in `lock` |
| **A single EVM timelock owner** | Cancel any pending operation, including a legitimate unpause or guardian rotation | Execute an operation alone | None at present — this is a liveness single point of failure ([T20](./docs/threat-model.md#t20--governance-liveness)) |
| **Soroban admin** | Rotate the LayerZero endpoint **instantly, with no delay** | — | `propose_peer`/`confirm_peer` have a 1-day delay; `set_endpoint` does not ([T18](./docs/threat-model.md#t18--instant-endpoint-rotation-on-soroban)) |

**The practical implication:** `skim` is bounded on-chain by per-token liability accounting (`totalLocked`), preventing the owner set from extracting active user deposits. The residual governance risk is that the owner can withdraw genuine surplus (e.g. fee-on-transfer residue, accidentally sent / donated tokens, or upward rebase surplus), while single-owner cancellation remains a liveness single point of failure ([T20](./docs/threat-model.md#t20--governance-liveness)) and Soroban endpoint rotation is instant ([T18](./docs/threat-model.md#t18--instant-endpoint-rotation-on-soroban)) — see [`docs/threat-model.md`](./docs/threat-model.md) §0 and T17–T20 for the full trust model, likelihood/impact assessment, and tracked mitigation issues.

## Handsoff notes

<!-- handsoff-issue-696 -->
- #696: evm: the rolling-window circuit breaker sets `rollingWindowTriggered` and then reverts, discarding it

<!-- handsoff-issue-697 -->
- #697: evm: `resetRollingWindowCap` does not clear the accumulated bucket, so the cap re-trips immediately

<!-- handsoff-issue-698 -->
- #698: evm: `lock` truncates `minDestAmount` from `uint256` to `uint128` without checking, weakening the under-delivery guard

<!-- handsoff-issue-699 -->
- #699: evm: `lock` truncates `deadline` to `uint64` without checking, which can open the refund window early

<!-- handsoff-issue-704 -->
- #704: evm: `cancelOwnershipTransfer` reverts with `NotOwner` when there is no pending transfer

<!-- handsoff-issue-705 -->
- #705: evm: the contract-level event-shape table omits three events that the contract emits

<!-- handsoff-issue-707 -->
- #707: evm: `_encodeFillInstruction` copies 125 bytes one at a time in unbounded Solidity loops

<!-- handsoff-issue-700 -->
- #700: evm: `eip712Domain()` reports the live `block.chainid` while `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is frozen at deployment

<!-- handsoff-issue-701 -->
- #701: evm: no recovery path for native token stranded in the escrow

<!-- handsoff-issue-702 -->
- #702: evm: `cancelExpired` is `whenNotPaused`, so governance can hold the guaranteed refund path shut indefinitely

<!-- handsoff-issue-703 -->
- #703: evm: `setPeer` accepts `bytes32(0)`, silently disabling all inbound settlement

<!-- handsoff-issue-685 -->
- #685: soroban: two warnings in `lib.rs` will fail the `clippy -D warnings` CI gate once the crate compiles

<!-- handsoff-issue-684 -->
- #684: soroban: `addr.to_string().to_string()` calls a method that does not exist on `soroban_sdk::String`

<!-- handsoff-issue-693 -->
- #693: relayer: the reorg-rollback test fails, leaving reorg handling unverified

<!-- handsoff-issue-694 -->
- #694: solver: ten tests fail against the `{records}` mempool envelope, disabling the verification-cache suite

<!-- handsoff-issue-691 -->
- #691: sdk: two `buildIntent` V_min warning tests fail because the warning now requires `sourceDecimals`
