/// @title Perihelion Escrow
/// @notice Source-chain leg of the Perihelion bridge, and a LayerZero OApp.
///
/// On `lock`, a solver locks the user's signed funds against `intent_hash` and a
/// FillInstruction is dispatched to the Stellar settlement contract. On a verified
/// `FillConfirmed`, the locked funds are released to the solver; on a `CancelIntent`
/// (or the local-timeout fallback `cancelExpired`), they are refunded to the user.
///
/// @dev The EIP-712 domain/type is byte-identical to `@perihelion/sdk` and the
///      Soroban side (Invariant I5). Inbound FillConfirmed/CancelIntent use the
///      fixed binary layout the Soroban contract emits (architecture spec §3.3).
///
///      ## Token compatibility
///      The measured-delta accounting at lock time handles fee-on-transfer tokens
///      correctly by recording the exact amount received. However, this contract
///      is NOT compatible with rebasing tokens (e.g., stETH) or tokens whose
///      balance changes after deposit (e.g., deflationary supply adjustments).
///      For such tokens, the balance attributable to a lock can drift between
///      lock and release, potentially causing a release/refund to fail
///      (insufficient balance) or succeed by drawing on another lock's fungible
///      balance. The `skim` function recovers surplus that cannot be attributed
///      to any active lock (e.g., from a rebase-up). Rebase-down scenarios can
///      result in stuck funds — operators should gate listed assets accordingly.
///
///      ## Event Shape Specification (issue #102)
///      Events are the off-chain integration surface for indexers, relayers, and
///      monitoring tooling. Each event shape below is a VERSIONED INTERFACE.
///      Changes to event topics or payloads MUST be reflected in the Soroban
///      contract (see `contracts/soroban/settlement/src/lib.rs`). The Soroban
///      topic column is the exact symbol the Soroban contract emits for the
///      analogous event (full names, never abbreviated; see
///      `docs/EVENT-SHAPES.md`). "-" means there is no Soroban analogue.
